<p>The launch of Gabriel Mendes&rsquo; book took place in the beautiful Chapel of St.
Anthony (Pátio D&rsquo;Água), which was very well organized by Mrs. Fernanda Pinho
from the Montijo City Council.</p>

<p>With a full &ldquo;house&rdquo;, this event was highlighted by an excellent performance by
Filipe Silva on guitar and vocals.</p>
<p>After our General Assembly President, Mrs. Anabela Monteiro, gave a brief
introduction of who we are and what we do at our association CIRCULODEMAJALIS,
it was the turn of Mrs. Esther from the MODOCROMIA publishing house to give a
brief editorial explanation.</p>

<p>The writer and director Domingos Lobo presented the book, and was, as expected,
eloquent and spectacular in his voice and literary analysis.</p>

<p>Cristina Comenda, Alzira Carrilho, and Rosário Freitas treated us to a
reading of three poems by the author, who also gave an emotional speech of
thanks to those present.</p>
<p>We were also surprised by the poet and photographer Vitor Costeira (who had
an exhibition on the same day), who also read one of the author&rsquo;s poems.</p>

<p>The event ended with music and socializing over a glass of Muscatel in the
chapel&rsquo;s lobby. Also present at this event were the head of the cultural
department, Dr. Manuela Marcelino, and the head of communications for the
Montijo City Council (CMM), Mr. Eduardo Martins, who has given so much support
to this association. Our thanks to all our MAJALIS friends for their presence
and support, and of course also to the CMM team who made this event possible.</p>
