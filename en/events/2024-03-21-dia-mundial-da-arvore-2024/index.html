    <p>To celebrate this day, we created a special <em>bonsai</em> tree with the help of the
community. This collective work was made from recycled materials from other
construction projects (pipes, coatings, wood, nets, etc.), as well as leftover
wool and wool purchased by all the participants.</p>

<p>A total of 1390 pom-poms were made, which were carefully crafted over the
course of several weeks.</p>
<p>On March 21st, with the collaboration of children and young people from the
parish, a magnolia tree was planted in the front garden of the Canha
Ethnographic Museum, symbolizing our commitment to nature.</p>

<p>The planting was accompanied by some senior residents of <em>Santa Casa da
Misericórdia</em>, who also participated in this meaningful action. After the task,
we had the privilege of welcoming the community involved in the project, as
well as those who were able to attend.</p>
<p>Everyone found the <em>bonsai</em> an interesting piece of work, and many took the
opportunity to take pictures next to it, celebrating the art and the
environment.</p>

<p>Next, we held a community snack, the main objective of which was to share and
promote healthy foods, strengthening the spirit of unity and care for our
health and the planet.</p>

<p>The children took home a pom-pom, along with a small brochure that explained
the importance of trees in the environment and in the lives of all beings that
inhabit our planet.</p>
